// this is the base-config for resource-finder
// the point of this file is that it will move outside the project
// (so that settings we put in it can be used by other projects)
// and be pulled in with an axios call or something
// (we might not need to use axios with new vue async tools)
// if that is not needed, we can move this info to main.js
